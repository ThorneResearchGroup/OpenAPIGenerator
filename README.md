# Open API Generator

Add this to your Palila based ActiveJ project to have OpenAPI specifications documents automatically generated. Use these templates to share information about the API between developers, or use Swagger CodeGen to generate client libraries in other languages for your API.

This will not work without Palila, as the way that endpoints are defined in ActiveJ vary from Palila. Palila added additional information which is required to generate the spec, and is mandatory.
